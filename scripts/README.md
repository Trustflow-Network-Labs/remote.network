# Decrypt Service Script

This script allows you to decrypt and decompress encrypted data services for testing and verification purposes.

## Usage

```bash
go run scripts/decrypt_service.go <service_id> <output_dir>
```

### Parameters

- `service_id`: The ID of the service in the database (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
- `output_dir`: Directory where decrypted and extracted files will be saved

### Example

```bash
go run scripts/decrypt_service.go 1 /tmp/test_decrypt
```

This will:
1. Read service details from the database
2. Retrieve the encryption passphrase
3. Decrypt `data/services/service_1_encrypted.dat`
4. Decompress the tar.gz archive
5. Extract all files to `/tmp/test_decrypt/extracted/`

## Output

The script provides detailed information about:
- Service details (file count, sizes, hash)
- Encryption information (passphrase, hash)
- Decryption process (file sizes)
- List of all extracted files with their sizes

## Directory Structure

After running, you'll find:
- `/tmp/test_decrypt/decrypted.tar.gz` - The decrypted tar.gz archive
- `/tmp/test_decrypt/extracted/` - All extracted files with preserved directory structure

## Requirements

- Go 1.24.6 or higher
- Access to the Remote Network database at `~/Library/Application Support/remote-network/remote-network.db`
- The encrypted service file must exist in `data/services/`

## Technical Details

### Encryption
- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
- Key derivation: PBKDF2 with SHA-256 (100,000 iterations)
- Nonce: 12 bytes (prepended to ciphertext)

### Compression
- Format: tar.gz
- Preserves directory structure
- Typical compression ratio: 28-30%

### Security Notes
- The passphrase is stored in the database for demonstration purposes
- In production, passphrases should be securely managed (e.g., key management service)
- The script displays the passphrase for verification - handle with care
