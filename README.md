**Remote Network Node** is a P2P networking implementation that combines BitTorrent DHT peer discovery with QUIC-based metadata exchange for NAT-friendly peer-to-peer communication.

---

## Features

- 🔍 **BitTorrent DHT Peer Discovery** - Uses proven DHT protocol for initial peer discovery
- 🔐 **QUIC Metadata Exchange** - Secure, bidirectional metadata exchange over QUIC streams
- 🗄️ **SQLite Peer Database** - Persistent storage of peer metadata with connection pooling
- 🌐 **NAT-Friendly Architecture** - Designed for peers behind NATs with private IP discovery
- 📊 **Memory Leak Monitoring** - Built-in pprof endpoints for performance monitoring
- 🎯 **Node Type Detection** - Automatic detection of public vs private node configuration

---

## Architecture

The node operates in three layers:

1. **DHT Layer** - BitTorrent DHT for peer discovery using `add_peer`/`get_peers` operations
2. **QUIC Layer** - Encrypted metadata exchange with bidirectional stream support
3. **Database Layer** - SQLite storage for peer metadata, network topology, and capabilities

### Peer Discovery Flow

```
DHT Peer Discovery → QUIC Connection → Bidirectional Metadata Exchange → SQLite Storage
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- SQLite support (CGO enabled for modernc.org/sqlite)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trustflow-Network-Labs/remote-network-node.git
cd remote-network-node

# Build
go build -o remote-network ./cmd/main.go
```

### Running

```bash
# Start the node
./remote-network start

# Enable memory monitoring (separate terminal)
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

### Linux Server Configuration

For optimal QUIC performance on Linux servers, configure UDP buffer sizes:

```bash
# Create sysctl configuration file
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/90-quic-buffers.conf
```

Add the following content:

```
# QUIC UDP buffer sizes
net.core.rmem_max=7500000
net.core.rmem_default=2500000
net.core.wmem_max=7500000
net.core.wmem_default=2500000
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
# Apply the new settings
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-quic-buffers.conf

# Or reload all sysctl configs
sudo sysctl --system

# Verify settings
sysctl net.core.rmem_max net.core.wmem_max
```

## Protocol Details

### DHT Implementation

- Uses standard BitTorrent DHT with `add_peer`/`get_peers` operations
- Custom topic-based peer discovery for network segmentation
- Automatic bootstrap node connectivity for network joining

### QUIC Metadata Exchange

- TLS-encrypted streams for secure peer communication
- Bidirectional metadata exchange on single streams (NAT-friendly)
- Structured message protocol with request/response correlation
- Support for future service discovery and hole punching

### Database Schema

Peer metadata includes:
- Node identification (ID, topic, endpoints)
- Network information (public/private IPs, NAT detection)
- Capabilities and service offerings
- Connection quality metrics

---
